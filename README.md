DjangoBlog
==========

This is a small side project intended to dip my toe into Django.

I am following Matthew Daly's tutorial (www.matthewdaly.co.uk) on how to build a website blog , incorporating log-in authentication, a basic CMS/editor, pagenation and a few other bits.

I currently intend to keep my personal site on the static Github pages, rather than say, the Django supporting Heroku but who knows...
